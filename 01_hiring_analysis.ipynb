    "A Jupyter notebook (what you are using right now) is an [Integrated Development Environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) (IDE) created by the [Jupyter Project](https://jupyter.org/). It allows you to combine different tools that are paramount for a good coding workflow. For example, you can have the terminal, a notebook, and a markdown file for note-taking/documenting your work, as well as other files, opened at the same time to improve your workflow as you write code.\n",
    "\n",
    "A silly metaphor to think about IDEs is that, IDEs are to programmers, data analysts, scientists, researcher, etc..., what a kitchen is to a chef, an indispensable piece of equipment to get things done.\n",

    "Jupyter notebooks are composed of cells and each cell has 3 states with the default one beign \"code\", and the other two being \"markdown\" and \"raw text\". The two latter ones can be used for note-taking purposes (e.g. this is a markdown cell).\n",
    "\n",
    "To run code you will use the following two commands:\n",

    "The first option will run the cell where you have your cursor at and take you to the next one. If there is no cell underneath the one you just ran, it will insert a new one for you.\n",

    "As mentioned previously, data structures help us hold data, and the one we have been using is called a dataframe. When we read data with pandas, we are reading in the equivalent of a spreadsheet but with more functionalities. Here are some of the other data structures you should be aware of. We will see more of these later, but here are some explanations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- lists - Lists in Python are some of the most versatile data structures available. They can hold multiple data types at the same time, and their elements can all be accessed using the same conventions as with strings plus more. To create a list you have to use square brackets `[ ]` and separate the values in them with commas `,`.\n",
    "- dictionaries - Dictionaries are analogous data structures to what is called a hash table. These dictionaries are key-value pairs of data where the key is the name or variable of the values (it can be a string or a number), and the value is any kind of data type (e.g. a list, another dictionary, numbers, strings, booleans, etc.) or data structure (e.g. another dictionary, a list, a set, a tuple, etc.). You can create a dictionary using brackets `var = {\"key\": value(s)}` and by separating the key and value with a column. Additional key-value pairs can be separated by a comma `,`.\n",
    "- tuples - Tuple are lists' cousins except that they are immutable. This means that the content of a tuple cannot be altered. What you can do instead is to take the elements inside a tupe out by what is called unpacking. Unpacking means taking them out of the tuple and putting them into another container (e.g. a variable) or another data structure, e.g. a list. Tuples are usually denoted with parentheses `()` or with commas `,` separating their elements.\n",
    "- sets - Sets are the more strict cousins of lists. While lists allow for multiple data types and structures in them, sets don't like to have the same data twice in them and also can't stand its cousins, the lists and the dictionaries. They do get along with their first cousins the tuples though. To get a set started, all you need is to create a data structure with a set of brackets `{}` around, in the same fashion you would create a dictionary but without the construct of `key : value`. You can also call the function `set()` on a list or tuple and this will return a set."
