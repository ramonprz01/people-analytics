    "It is not just how many individuals one is connected too, but the type of people one is connected with that can decide the importance of a node. With that in mind, **Eigenvector Centrality** is what helps us measure of how import a node is (its influence/prestige) by accounting for how well that same node is connected to other well-connected nodes. The score goes from 0 to 1 and the higher the score of a node, the more surrounded by other important nodes (i.e. nodes with high centrality) it will be.\n",

    "Here are some of the most important concepts covered in this session:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A network is a graph composed of nodes and edges\n",
    "    - Nodes can represent people, locations, companies, etc.\n",
    "    - Edges are the links connecting different nodes with one another.\n",
    "- Centrality measures help us answer questions related to the importance of the nodes within our networks. There are plenty of such measures and some, like the ones we have covered in this course, are used more frequently than other to drive business outcomes.\n",
    "- Degree centrality represents the raw frequencies of the network nodes, the higher the frequency of the edges a node has, the higher the degree of such node within the network.\n",
    "- Betweenness centrality picks nodes not based of the amount of connections they have but rather on how well they connect unconnected groups of well-connected nodes.\n",
    "- Eigenvector Centrality can help us pinpoint prestige, that is, highly connected nodes that are also connected to other highly connected dots."
