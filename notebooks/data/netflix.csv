You're treated like an adult. You're part of a pro team that is highly functioning. The company is well respected and has a super positive brand awareness -- i'm never able to go anywhere without getting peppered with raves and happy customer comments, and i love wearing company logo gear when i'm out for this reason.

You matter at Netflix. There is no dead wood, everyone is doing something very important to the company or they wouldn't be there. What you are doing matters and makes a difference, and that feels good. You can really make a difference no matter what your role.

The company often repeats that as an employee, you're not on an olympic team -- meaning, you don't do this 24/7 with no life, with all focus on the gold. WE're more of a varsity team, playing to win, very good, but still have to balance with classes and learning. We need to have a good work/life balance and its very important to the company that we do. 

I think the best thing - and its subtle - is this no vacation/no holiday stuff. you work when you work. they seem to realize that everyone is working hard and all the time. nights. weekends often. a ton of hard work. so if you want to take time off for a vacation, a long holiday, a day off, whatever- it happens at your own discretion. you don't ask, you don't get permission. you just do what you have to do. no one is keeping track. i've never heard of this kind of policy and you cannot imagine what it doest for your morale, for feeling like you're being treated like a grown up. For that rule alone I think it stands beyond any other org.","Netflix is not for everyone. You don't get ""direction"" so much as everyone shares a common understanding of company strategy and goals. You are free to work, and some will find this harder than just being told what to do. Netflix doesn't have ""average"" workers - everyone is high functioning, highly motivated and independent, and expectations are enormous. There is nothing like a career position here. There is high turn over, and its unnerving to many. There is an understanding: ""good average work and productivity does not get a modest raise, but a generous severence."" 

It's a pro team, and the team fit is also as important as the individual performance. You could be excellent, but if you're not HIGHLY communicative, cooperative, egoless, you can get cut just in the team balancing of moving quickly and effectively. 

you must be able and willing to share early and often about everything. projects that are new and forming get debated and you have to defend your position and hear critique well. recognizing that criticism is of the work and not you is essential -- a thin skin won't work well. quiet hard work doesn't work well (for some engineers perhaps); you don't ask permission, but you must be able to clearly articulate why you do what you are doing, and support this position. you must realize that ideas are not fragile, and only through debate with smart people who share your understanding of company goals and strategy will ideas be improved.

This is serious work. It's really fun, but make no mistake, it's hard and not for everyone.","I have none. Senior management is fantastic. smart. focused. they lead by example and guide through real socratic debate with everyone. no one is unapproachable. everyone is candid. i couldn't ask for a better team of officers, and VPs, within the company."

They appear to be very with it.  The call center attempts to echo that sentiment, and provides many perks that make work an alright place to be.  From the free coffee and refreshments in the cafeteria to the free rental plan, great benefits, and competitive pay, there is a great ideal that the company attempts to live up to - that the people populating the center are worth the extra buck or two.  It was refreshing to work for a company that was capable of identifying problems, and instead of sweeping them under the rug, took the initiative to change the problem.","Specific to the Hillsboro location, the middle-management is hit-or-miss with whether or not they treat you like a valued member of the team.  Many of the team managers do not communicate clearly with their teams - as a member of the support staff, it was evident which managers were taking the time to coach, train, and encourage their teammates, and which were not.  Many reps who were extremely good at their job were let go for seemingly innocuous reasons, veiling the manager's personal dislike for the individual.  The Hillsboro center has been open since September of 2006, and very few (if any) original cast members from the first three training classes exist.  The management of the call center was not in any way stable; the entire team had been replaced once over, and in the less-than two years, they've gone through two site directors.  With all of the management, quality, and training staff adjustments, many representatives felt as though getting promoted was a death knell to your time at Netflix.  NOT that there were copious opportunities for advancement - quite the contrary.  Team managers were hired from outside of the company, and rarely were promotions from within occurring.  There were a handful of people who did move up the ladder, and, as previously mentioned, found themselves restructured out of the company, told that there was no longer work for them to do and laid off, or outright fired because they ""don't fit the way the department is going.""","To the senior-most management in Los Gatos, I would ask that you send some sort of internal affairs mole into the call center.  Hire someone to see what it's like from the floor's perspective, as naturally the team managers are putting on their best face for you.  See what their day-to-day face looks like, and see how it compares.  Because you very well might see that some of the individuals in places of authority don't seem to know, in the colloquial, their arse from a hole in the ground."

And who doesn't want to work ""in the movies""?  The pay is pretty decent, the benefits are acceptable.","It's frustrating to work for direct management who treat you like you're an inconvenience but yet you still provide them with reason to boast about top-rated customer service.  Lack of communication.  And unless you want to be management, lack of challenge and opportunities for growth.  ""Job security"" doesn't really exist for anyone in the Oregon office.  Innovation is encouraged yet support for implementing innovation is negligent at best.","Stop being so secretive, just be upfront and honest!  Learn to communicate, take the suggestions given seriously instead of treating everyone like they have no idea what they're talking about.

I wouldn't even say that SOME of the people are good while others somehow seemed to 'slip' in. If you aren't one of the best in your line of work, I don't think you'll ever get in the door here. I've been here for a number of years and have had the privilege to work with some extremely bright people. As an employee (and part of a team), its good to know that whatever you are working on is going to be top notch because of who is working on it.

Netflix also encourages you to learn and explore new technologies and expand your own knowledge base. At past companies this was always a problem. If something didn't directly relate to what you were working on... well you had to make excuses and come up with reasons why you wanted to try something new. At Netflix, they not only encourage it but really urge you to try to broaden your own skill set.

Our paid time off policy is not to be beat... Netflix has none! No two weeks a year or so many days off for personal/sick leave GARBAGE. Instead, you just tell your manager that you wanted to take three weeks off next month and he says, okay have a good time. We'll see ya when you get back! How cool is that?

Its all about Movies for me. I used to think I was a bit if a movie buff. Yeah, that was until I worked here and met real movie buff's. Meetings are filled with references to movies. In one of the team meetings I go to every week, you can count the number of Ferris Bueller's day off lines.

$$$ Show me the money. Netflix really does pay well! I left my old job doing the EXACT same thing I do here.. the only difference is, I make X2 as much! 

I'd like to write more, but those reasons alone are pretty good.","When I first started, the head of HR said ""Netflix is a high performance environment."" Often, I feel like they have confused ""high pressure"" with ""high performance"", and believe me, there is a difference. Sometimes I feel like they overly eggagerate the importance of SOME features. I mean, no one is going to die on the table here guys.. its just a movie rental company.

Our medical/health benefits are mediocre at best and HR doesn't seem to care that the majority of employees are totally dissatisfied with the offerings. After constant employee complaints on how high our benefit prices are, HR comes back with even higher prices this year while having even less coverage. I'm not buying the line they fed us either ""benefits are more expensive everywhere across the country."" Whatever.. if I gave that as an excuse why I didn't get a project completed on time, I'd be ""talked to"".

Every year, we have this total JOKE of a per review process (360 reviews). You HAVE to rate your peers and get ratings back from the people you asked to rate you. From my experience, its totally pointless and a huge waste of time / energy across the company. If we spent even a quarter of the time and money it takes to run, manage, and maintain this 360 review process, we'd have double the amount of movies in our Watch Instantly offering.

Don't come here thinking you'll rise through the ranks! That just doesn't happen here. Yes, there are a few people who have started out as individual contributors and risen to the higher ranks but for the most part, I've watched very talented people leave Netflix to get management positions else where and Netflix doesn't really care. When you accept a job here, it will most likely be in the same position for the rest of your time at Netflix.

There is also a very big brother feel here.. Netflix HR is watching you. But maybe that's just me! People seem to 'disappear' sometimes!",None really. I have been very impressed with what direction the company is going. Decisions that I thought were misguided have really turned out well. My only real gripe with Netflix is Benefits and HR!

Self motivated people can have a great career experience.  Netflix is filled with mature adults that are not politically motivated.  Netflix management does a pretty good job of setting the proper context for employees and letting them run independently.  Employees enjoy a culture of freedom and responsibility that few other companies offer.  As an example, we have no vacation policy, you take what you need.  If you are excessive or not performing at a great level, you will be called out on it.

If you are lucky enough to be offered a job at Netflix, take it, you won’t regret it.  You will be exposed to a company culture unlike another you have ever experienced.","Not a great place to come if you don’t have a fair amount of experience.  We are not a great incubation center for people right out of college.  Health care and other benefits are not the best.

There is a fair amount of career advancement available at the lower levels, but it is pretty thin at the upper levels such as director & vice president.  Not sure the pat at or above market value for employees is 100% true in all cases.","In general, senior management has their act together pretty well.

Reed Hastings, the CEO, is probably the CEO that I have most respected in my career, and I feel he pretty consistently makes good decisions and moves the company in the correct direction.  
Netflix has a very quantitative approach to almost everything, including detailed user testing for their products, so there is a lot to learn about that.  The other employees are generally cool people, and fairly smart in general.  The user interface aspects of the website are strong, so again, there is a learning opportunity.  The company wide meetings are fun, and entail good communication.","In the website development group, there is two week development cycle.  That means that there is a push to the website every two weeks.  This has a few consequences.  One is that there is a high percentage of overhead (testing and release stuff) compared to actual development time.  There is not much time for software design in such a scheme, there is always a rush to hit the next two week time click.  Longer term projects are tougher to schedule and short term thinking dominates.  
The performance policy is that anyone who, if they quit, would not be attempted to talk out if it, should be fired preemptively (a hair trigger threshold for firing, basically).  This creates a chilling effect in my opinion.  I have seen fairly senior management that disagreed with their boss being (farily apparently) fired.  This creates a bit of a yes man environment, something that Netflix would deny (perhaps even to themselves).   There is very little empowement of employees in real decisions, and decision making is very top down, with the resulting motivation hit that entails.","Even going to a three week release cycle would help things a lot.  The counter argument is that that would lead to more pressure to have inter-release ""patches"", but I think the overhead percentage would drop a lot (like 50%) and that owuld make it worth it (if you don't patch a bug for a 2 week cycle, do you really need to patch it for 3?  I think the culture of keeping decision making in a very few hands at the top is working OK because Reed makes the right decisions, but it may prove poisonous if he ever leaves, and it will be too late to turn the cultural tide."

They have good snacks. They pay a pretty high cash salary. You get to claim that you're in the movie business.","Netflix makes a big deal about their hiring policies. They claim that they regularly evaluate employee performance, and let the lowest performers go. To me, this sounded great! In contrast to many other companies where lazy and incompetent people hang around for years, Netflix tried to retain only the best and brightest people.

Unfortunately, that's not what it was like in reality. A week after I started at Netflix, the recruiter who hired me was unceremoniously dismissed. Then the tech support guy in our office was released. Then an engineer on my team. In each of these cases, it wasn't clear what these folks had done wrong. They had all been technically competent, friendly and hard working. This promoted a culture of fear where no one felt that their job was secure.

It turns out that there were several things going on. Managers were given incentives to regularly purge employees. So, managers developed antagonistic relationships with employees. In most normal companies, a key responsibility of a manager is to defend their team in front of senior management. At Netflix, this just doesn't happen.

Additionally, Netflix doesn't have adequate mechanisms for providing feedback and review to employees. (In the year I spent at Netflix, I didn't receive a single review, positive or negative.) Without a formal system for employee evaluation, managers resort to picking favorites: they hire in their friends, and fire people who they aren't friends with. I saw this happen to many different people while I was at Netflix. It's allowable by law (everyone is an ""at will"" employee), but it does not lead Netflix to hire and retain the best people.

Netflix has had the good fortune to be in an easy business. They moved early into online DVD rentals, and have large cost advantages over potential rivals. Their competitors (Blockbuster, Walmart, etc) took major missteps, and were not really able to compete. Netflix doesn't have to be the best at anything they do: operations, marketing, movie recommendations, etc. They just have to be OK at these things to run a profitable business, and they are only OK at them.","The key problem with Netflix is in their HR policies. Netflix needs to establish formal job responsibilities for all employees, establish goals for individuals, and measure employee performance against those goals."

Netflix makes no secret about it's high performance culture, which results in a very high turnover. Average life expectancy in this office is about 2 years, which means very often the main knowledge base of a department exists when an employee is terminated (not always for fair reasons) or chooses to leave since there is no room to grow. There are conflicting values and many managers don't practice what Netflix preaches. If you associate with the right people, this can help your career, but it is disappointing that office politics factors so heavily into a company that preaches how different they are from other corporate cultures. Yes, it's great we all get Blackberries or iPhones (and are reachable 24/7) and have a liberal vacation policy, but the aura of paranoia that invades the office due to the frequent restructurings is not conducive to successful business practices.",The culture in the main headquarters in San Jose is different and very disconnected from the BH office.

Not a lot above market, but a bit above market. The drawback is there are absolutely no benefits to speak of (no health benefits, no training, no daycare) so that above market pay gets eaten up pretty fast by real world needs.","A total fear of failure permeates the ranks.  Netflix basically gives you a warning on your first mistake, and then fires you after your second mistake.  This is why the annual turnover rate is well over 20%.  Since there is an entirely new set of employees every few years, nobody knows what process to follow, and everything is chaotic.  HR solves this by saying ""there is no process for anything! Make it up as you go along!""  Sure, if I fired all the employees every few years I'd stay away from process too.  

The key problem is that with all the firings most employees spend the day simply trying to find cover.  The ass covering at Netflix is legendary.  Nobody wants to innovate.  Nobody wants to reach outside their comfort zone.  Netflix has created a culture of fear, and the way in which they manage terminations reinforces the culture of fear (they immediately demonize the terminated employee, and try to make the termination serve as a lesson to others). 

The culture of fear is so ingrained in Netflix that many managers only have one tool for managing their directs, and that is to threaten to fire them.  There simply is no other process for managing poor performance (remember, there is no process - they will admit this to you if you ask).

And finally, the last thing you should be warned about is their ""high performance"" culture.  Their justification for all the firings is that the fired employees weren't high performers.  But since there is no process, no record-keeping, there is no objective measurement of performance.  So ""high performers"" end up being the employees that get along with the boss and keep a low profile.  ""High performers"" at Netflix are not employees that take risks, interact with outside groups, or produce a high volume of work.    

Netflix loves to talk about high performance but they have the lowest standard for high performance that I've ever seen.  They are completely happy to manage with fear, however.  If you put those two insane concepts together you end up with a rather hysterical environment.","So you guys did one thing well, a long time ago, and you've been marginally improving that business (DVD rental) ever since.  Your astoundingly high turnover rate worked in that world, because all the processes were in place.  But now you are trying to get into the streaming business, and that business only runs with knowledge workers at the helm.  And guess what? Knowledge workers are pretty well-connected.  The word is out that Netflix does not value its employees and as a result it's going to be harder and harder to staff your new ventures.  You really need to find the groups at Netflix with the highest turnover and keep those managers away from the streaming business.  You have some managers that simply do not know how to manage, they only know how to fire and hire.  As much as you love to say that firing and hiring is what management is all about, you could not be more wrong.  Find the teams with low turnover, they are the teams that work in spite of your chaotic work environment."

Management has a funny way of saying just enough to cover their rears later on if they decide to write you up or axe you outright. It was incredible watching what seemed like casual ""coaching tips"" turn into do or die ultimatums in hindsight. Be crystal clear about expectations. 

-Listen to the reps. Really. The CSRs are treated like generic cogs in a big machine. There's a lot of people working the front lines that are just as qualified (maybe more so) than management to be running the place, yet they don't have a real voice.

I was very happy with the people I worked with, as I made some really good friends while working there, and that is the only positive thing that came out of Netflix.  I now shop the Redbox.","Customer Service is not simply a game of numbers.  As a Customer Service Representative, and as a former Customer Service Manager, and trainer, with a reputable company, who Netflixs' own Michael Osier, vice president for information technology operations and customer service, based the Hillsboro call center after; my advice is to focus generally on the broad customer service experience and not sweat the small stuff.  A good former CEO of Southwest Airlines once said ""We can't take ourselves too seriously""  If you're not having fun, and treating your people with decency, the you will have a poisonous atmosphere that is impossible to come back from.

Even during my firing she was on her phone texting. I was given no information outside of a prepared packet and was asked to sign zero paperwork. I was escorted from the building like a criminal and the only reason anyone knew I had left was because of a pre-written email I was able to send when I returned to my desk to gather my things.

In the nine days I was there for training before being unfairly dismissed, I saw several examples of employees being treated like children and unreasonably scolded. One girl was in the classroom 5 minutes before break was over. She suddenly had a bathroom emergency, so she left quickly to take care of it. She made it back just as they were shutting the door. On the next break, she was taken aside by the supervisor (supe) who said, ""I noticed you made it back from break just as I was shutting the door. I just wanted to let you know that's unacceptable. You need to be back from break several minutes early."" (In other words, you really don't get your full break.) She apologized, saying she'd been there five minutes early but had an emergency. He said, ""I'm sure it won't happen again.""

One girl had to call in sick because her child gave her the flu. They forced her to speak to three different people who scolded her, the last of which was the call center manager himself! He said he was going to give her the opportunity to come in for the rest of the week. 

Another girl simply asked her neighbor for a pen during class. She was pulled into a conference room afterward and told by two different supes that talking during class was unacceptable and wouldn't be tolerated. 

Netflix has a zero-tolerance policy for what they call ""push back"". They touched on this very briefly in class during our second week of training. The example they gave was this: ""If your supe tells you to change something and you say, 'I don't feel like it, so I'm not going to', that's considered push back and will not be tolerated."" Basically, it's outright insubordination. My supe said I needed to work on verifying every account. When people call in, their account auto-pops onscreen....unless they don't give their service code to the automated answering service before they're transferred to a live person. This happens about half the time and it's mostly people who don't have accounts and are just asking about the service. So I asked my supe, ""Is that even when they're just calling with a general question about the website?"" He said we needed to at least ask for a name and warned me that what I'd just said was considered push back but he'd let it slide this time. I was baffled but just said, ""Okay."" The same supe told me he liked that I was resolution oriented because that was a good thing. An hour later, he took it back saying it was bad and I needed to focus on empathy. When I was let go, they gave me the opportunity to give feedback. I mentioned the contradictions I'd noticed and also that I didn't understand how asking a simple question during training was considered ""push back"". I was told that it's all about perception and I just wasn't a right fit. They also said this sort of thing happens often.

Before you go to work for Netflix, ask yourself this: if the pay is excellent and the benefits are great, why is the turnover rate at Netflix so high??? Why are there so many bad employee reviews out there? Notice the recurring themes in the reviews, i.e. lack of respect, no job security, fear based business, no career growth opportunity, etc. There comes a time when the realization that it's not everybody else, it's the company, has to set in.","Be more reasonable with your employees. Maybe if you applied the same amount of empathy you insist on for call flow to your staff, people would be more inclined to stay with you."

I've met some great people while working there, both peers and supervisors.  

For the most part, customer support is incredibly easy, because the service itself works pretty smoothly.  When it doesn't, CS reps have the power to make things right for customers, which is fabulous.

Unlimited time off (within reason, and when it's available) is awesome.","Ultimately, the cons outweigh the pros.  I will be voluntarily leaving Netflix for a new job in the very near future.

Netflix treats employees like they're completely expendable.  I realize that no one is indispensable to a company, but Netflix uses up employees like I use up tissues when I have a cold.  The turnover is ridiculous, and it doesn't have to be that way.

For CS reps, the main statistic used to determine our ""worthiness"" is the DSAT.  Customers get asked a simple question after contacting customer service: ""Were you satisfied with the call?""  A ""no"" response counts against the rep, even if it was something the rep couldn't control (I'm sorry, it looks like your bank declined your card for this month's service fee.), or the customer was making an unreasonable demand (I got a disc that won't play!  Give me six months of free service or I'm cancelling!).  Netflix's stance is that we should be able to sugar-coat bad news so well that the customer doesn't hang up unhappy.  This method of measurement is incredibly flawed and has led to reps ""gaming"" the system to avoid ""no"" responses.  

Netflix does not give raises.  Period.  Not for cost of living, not for length of time employed, not even for outstanding performance.  I have worked there 3+ years and my stats have been stellar the whole time.  So stellar, I'm one of the people they have trainees shadow, to hear how to handle calls properly.  I have *never* gotten a raise.  Monetarily, Netflix considers my value to be the same as a new hire who just got out of training.

No paid time off.  (Unless I want to take a pay cut and bank that toward paid time off.)

Mandatory overtime during the holidays.  (They're promising it won't happen again this year, but that's what they said last year ... and we had mandatory overtime for three months last winter.  And the winter before.)

Extremely limited career options - unless you want to be a CS supervisor, you're pretty much out of luck at the call center.

Narrow-focus hiring - Netflix hires people with EXACTLY the skills they need for a particular position.  If that position goes away, so does the person.  There is very little provision for cross-training or retraining a good employee to fit them in somewhere else.

TRaSE - one exception to the cross-training policy has been TRaSE, which is a disaster, so far.  TRaSE combined the department that handles streaming tech support escalations with the department that handles loss prevention: billing fraud, shipping issues, physical inventory problems and website content issues.  They all received cross-training, and even though there's more people to handle problems now, CS reps can never get a response when they have an urgent loss prevention issue.  Reps have to tell customers ""someone will get back to you within 1-3 business days.""  What happened to ""one call resolution""?  There's a guaranteed ""no"" response for my DSAT.  Thanks a lot.

Workforce Management can't seem to forecast how much staff is needed; we will have weeks where they offer to let reps go home early every day, and then a couple of weeks later, they're offering voluntary extra hours and begging people to stay after their shifts.  This is probably related to the fact that Marketing doesn't feel like they need to let anyone know about promotions until the last minute.

Speaking of Marketing, they don't seem to feel a need to ask anyone what kind of impact various promotions will have on the rest of Netflix's operations.  The ""no credit card necessary for a free trial"" promo was a fiasco, much of which could have been avoided by asking some seasoned reps a few key questions.  

The same can be said about some of the ""tests"" that Engineering sets up on the website.  Isn't it logical to maybe ask a few questions of the people who actually talk to the customers before you try something out?  I realize that we need to find out what works and what doesn't, but if a ""test"" makes the service unusable or unpalatable for a customer and they call to complain, CS reps can't remove them from the ""test"".  Netflix is willing to lose the customer because that's a valid ""test result"".  There has to be a better way.

The Canadian service was launched prematurely, in my opinion.  Many of the calls we get from Canadian customers center on the lack of content, especially newer releases.  The Canadian streaming library will grow, just like the US library, but that's not a satisfying answer to Canadian customers.  Thanks for another ""no"" response on my DSAT, Marketing department!","The service works so well.  Figure out a way to make your human resources department work at least half as well.  You are losing good employees at a ridiculous rate, which is going to start affecting customer satisfaction, and ultimately, your bottom line.  Dealing with the general public is stressful enough; your outstanding employees shouldn't have to deal with unfair treatment from you, as well."

Too much of this is dependent on whether they're working for a competent manger that is assumed to properly apply the ""high performance culture"" philosophy.

The desire to streamline HR by getting rid of almost all policies and procedures means no ""professional development"" for your management teams.  There needs to be a level of education for new managers (hired and promoted.  Don't assume everyone ""get's it"" in order to make sure the ""high performance culture"" is properly applied.  Done right, people will know what's expected of them, get regular feedback from their managers, and KNOW if they're on the short list for being let go as business needs change.  They can react to this and either adapt or anticipate why they're getting a severance package.  For most employees, Netflix is a short-term roller-coaster ride with options to ride again for those who enjoy it.  When someone exits the ride, you want them leaving with a smile and the civil handshake, not a brick to the head and a just a check to cushion the pain.

6.  Well known brand with instant street recognition.  
7.  Facilities are pretty good.","1.  Look at the comments on this site around turnover, treating people poorly, sick culture, and weak senior leadership.  These are all very accurate.
2.  No training, management training, or development.  The philosophy is if you don’t have what we need, we will replace you (i.e., fire you for not being a “good fit”) with someone from the outside who has that.  
3.  Hourly jobs in particular have stagnant pay.  
4.  There are no bonuses or incentives.
5.  The culture has serious problems.  
  a.  You will see countless references on this site to a “culture of fear”.  This is widespread in every department and division.  Even executives laugh that their time is numbered.  A company that functions on fear is not a place for the long term.  When everyone in a room is asked do they fear being fired and everyone says yes, that is a big problem.
  b.  A culture of watching your back and stabbing others in the back.  Many employees, including C level people, participate and have learned that tossing others under the bus, keeps them safe.   They see this as a way to protect themselves from scrutiny from above.  Employees and managers are all too comfortable talking about what is not working with a person.   The 360 review process reinforces this.  Those who have been there the longest are almost soulless with regard to firings.  They have fired or seen so many people let go that they don’t really care anymore.   
6.  You can be fired without warning, feedback, or any coaching.   Most employees don’t bring any personal belongings to work as they could be let go at any moment.  It is often a surprise.
7.  Do not move for a job with Netflix.  If your partner or spouse doesn’t work, you could be risking your families financial health.  There is no job security regardless of how good you are.  Performance does not equal security at Netflix.  
8.  Managers have a 1 year shelf life before they get shown the door.  Directors and VPs are constantly evaluating managers, so anytime you make a mistake, are perceived not to be cutting edge, it could be your turn.
9.  HR’s job is to hire and show people the door.  HR brags about how good they are at firing people.  They don’t help employees, nor are they there to help employees become better.   Their role is simply to ensure the company doesn’t get sued and headhunt for all the people that are turning over.  
10. Managers main role is making their team better through constrantly looking for their weaker employees.  Leaders are asked could they hire someone better.  Of course the answer will always be yes.
11.  No severance package is enough to compensate you for disruption in your career, moving, or the stress that comes without having a job.  
12.  The recruiting function will hire you fast.  The idea is to keep you excited, but if you are reading this don’t get caught up in the Netflix product of movies—look at whether this is actually a place you want to work.
13.  It’s incredibly stressful and life-shortening for you and your loved ones.  Why work at a place where people, including your hiring managers, treat you as completely disposable?","1.  Change out your HR leadership.  They are in love with the culture, but they are creating an unhealthy long term environment.  Once the economy picks up you will not be able to treat people as poorly as you do.
2.  Change the culture of fear.  Install real coaching, feedback, and performance reviews so employees can feel comfortable doing their jobs.   
3.  Do some employee surveys to learn the real thoughts of your front line team. 
4.  Stop the turnover that is higher than comparable companies.
5.  Reed, if you are not a people person, hire some people who are.  You will get better performance from people who are not in constant fear of being fired.  You can still remove weak performers, but don’t make even your best employees fear for their jobs."

Opportunity to advance and stay challenged for a call-center environment is above average...catch 22 of this is listed below.","In this company, what you know and who you know go hand in hand.  Floor management is given independence to run their teams their way, provided they hit goals and don't draw too far outside the lines.  This in some ways creates a public school environment: Some teachers inspire their students...some make them want to drop out entirely.  From the top down there is a constant but rather inconsistent level of pressure to perform or face termination.  When there is a lull in customer volume, employees are given adequate time and support to develop their skills...if the volume spikes unexpectedly however, external pressure related to the bottom line overrules, and suddenly everyone in the center is under the guillotine again.  As an employee that has seen 80% of the center (now 900 strong) replaced with fresh meat in only a years time, and a large number of those let go having equal or better performance than my own (networking is key),  it is frustrating to see so much talent go to waste on a regular basis as a result of a supervisor's&lt;team manger's&lt;director's&lt;corp exec's own stress to perform-or-face-a-similar-fate mentality.  Going back to the Pros, you can advance rapidly if you make people notice the positive things you do at the right time, because every level in the hierarchy drops like flies.","SLOW DOWN and don't lose your center!  When you have potential competitors with pocketbooks 1000x the size I realize this is difficult, but it is not a positive position to be in from an internal culture standpoint.  If expansion continues without re-evaluation of what makes the company worth working for other than the paycheck, you will exhaust your talent pool, be forced to outsource, and turn into just another company with a generic, pre-programmed message: ""What other choice do you have?"""

On a related note Netflix praises itself to have extremely talented people. This might have been the case but the talent density is certainly not the same as it used to be. A lot of the good people left recently and a lot of the deadwood hangs around because they will never be able to get a comparable salary elsewhere. There are the occasional firings going on but that is just scratching the surface.

As most of reviews say, it is incredible to see how open and honest the culture is. The company is still pretty flat for its size, and you can feel your impact on initiatives you work on. Development moves very fast and our cycles are short and iterative. Multiple 6-month long projects in other companies get out the door in a matter of a few weeks.

I definitely feel like reviews on Glassdoor do not make justice to the Netflix environment. Yes, there is a lot of work, but I do not feel people get let go all the time, or that anyone would feel scared of being fired without reason. People do not get let go without fair warning. Everyone I know that has been let go so far saw it coming and recognizes it is the best for both them and the company. I find it hard to believe sometimes we have to overcome people's fears in that aspect. And newcomers realize very fast there is a myth and feel great to have joined. 

In short, it is a remarkable, fair and candid company and I am thrilled to have joined and I plan to go nowhere in the next 5 years.","I agree there is no career plan or defined development, but then again, this translates into a lot of freedom to forge your own path. Plus, people who are hired are usually senior, so I feel there is less of a need for a strict career plan. When you work at Netflix, you are exposed to so much that it is easy to explain why you grow so much in a short period of time.","One of the biggest fears within the company is that our amazing culture gets diluted as we grow, so it is important to continue investing to keep the culture alive."

Now imagine the 5 best of those on one team. That's what working on a team at Netflix is like. Frankly, there are no stupid people here. None. Everyone I've met is damn sharp, very sharing of their knowledge and time, and enjoys what they do. 

You are treated like an adult. You are not told what to do. Netflix is laissez faire, not command and control. With that comes responsibility and the potential for failure. If you fail often enough, you will not survive. If you don't expose yourself to this risk enough, you won't survive. Some people might consider this a downside, you won't like it at Netflix if you do.

The Netflix time off/vacation policy is that there is no policy. They don't track how many hours you take. You take time off when you want to, you don't have to ask for permission or approval. This non-policy is one example of many of how thoroughly Netflix expects you to behave like an adult. I've spent many years at big name valley companies. Without exception, everyone of them claims that they treat employees like adults. All of them pale in comparison to Netflix in this regard.","I'm a developer, and the code base at Netflix has warts that demonstrate its laissez faire culture. There is no architecture group with veto power, so the code evolves organically - I personally think this is great, but it can be frustrating. Luckily, it never stays ""ugly"" for long, but it frequently feels like a ball of mud.

There seems to be quite a bit of turnover. The first month I worked here, I counted at least 5 ""good bye"" emails. At least 4 of them were not voluntary. This can be disconcerting. But this is also not a company like Cisco, with regular annual headcount reduction quotas.",Keep doing what you're doing.

Not hampered by lots of processes or structure, employees are empowered to find the best and most direct solutions to their problems
- Great work environment that's casual but high performance.  The emphasis is on results, and not on face time in the office.  If you need to take time off or work from home, you can, as long as your work gets done
- Full of really smart, fun people.  You get the chance to work with a lot of highly competent and impressive employees.
- Typical benefits are fine (health insurance, etc.), but the extra perks are especially nice, such as no vacation limit and a generous hardware/gadget policy
- It's nice to work for a brand that consumers love.  People tend to get excited when they hear you work at Netflix.
Overall, Netflix is one of the best work environments I've been in, except for a few major downsides ...","- There is essentially no career growth or promotions within the company.  Most positions are filled externally, and people tend to stay in the exact same job for a couple of years before they get frustrated and leave.  This is the number one employee complaint, which senior management knows about and seems to implicitly support
- Very high turnover, due to both voluntary departures and frequent terminations.  High pressure, high performance culture coupled with frequent firings often create a culture of fear
- Titles are deflated one level lower than the rest of the industry.  This is fine while at Netflix (compensation is usually appropriate for the work you do), but can be difficult once you want to leave Netflix and are looking for your next job
- As a growing company, there are increasing office politics.  Netflix is no longer a small start-up, and it's suffering its growing pains as it becomes a large, established company
Overall, most employees love working at Netflix, but eventually get frustrated by the lack of career growth.","Value your employees as long-term assets, before you drive away great people.  Good job in keeping Netflix a nimble, results-oriented place to work"

Netflix does not have a policy regarding sick days so as to hold it against you when you cannot make it to work (even if you provide a doctor's note).  In nine months I called out sick twice and still received warnings not to miss work.  Netflix promotes itself as striving to have the best customer service, however has reduced it's training too only two weeks.  One week in classroom and the next week on the floor taking calls.  The training is insufficiect which leads to inconsistency on the call center floor and the information which is relayed to customers.  The turn over rate is ridiculous.  I managed to work there for nine months before my part time shift was taken away and forced to go full time.  I was not able to work full time due to childcare needs and was told that either I take the shift I am given (which is based on call volumes and business needs only) or I can quit.  Netflix refused to work out a schedule that would let me keep my job there and work with their needs as well.  Netflix anticipates doing a shift bid every six months, which means there is no gurantee you will be able to stay at the shift that you are hired for, and no room for disscussion.  So if you have small children or attend school this is not a suitable job.  Netflix promotes a no policy policy environment, which gives each individual team manager and leader to do as they see fit.  One day they will tell you you are doing a great job, the next you will be let go.  Netflix call center fired employees for not being able to make it to work due to snowstorms that hit hard in December 2008.  Roads were not plowed, public transportation was not running, and yet you were let go.  People were in accidents trying to get to work.  Other's they put up in a hotel to make sure they would make their shift.  Netflix had random mandatory OT in some cases without any notice.  It wasn't just that they required a set amount of extra hours from everyone, they only had specific hours in which had to be filled.  My husband had to take days off work so I could meet their required OT.   Again no flexiblity with regards to family needs.
Overall it's just really sad because this job was and could be fun.  It's about movies and tv shows and all the great changes that are happening with the internet and instant streaming.  Still it is a call center and those jobs aren't always the best, however when the entire company is working so hard against their own employess, the job is terrible.  It's not even something you can count on because you don't know when they will fire you and for what.","Invest some more time in actually keeping decent employees instead of degrading everyone who works there.  Most of the employees have college degrees and years of customer service experience.  Netflix is known around the world for it's great service. Great numbers and feedback come from happy employees, not from those scared every moment that they are going to be fired next.

The people driving these changes will try to convince you that it's positive, innovative, progressive.  I say those people are just coming up with ways to make themselves look like they're working hard.

Granted, there have been some positive changes.  But the recent reorganization that occurred with the latest shift bid?  I used to have a competent supervisor who would help me when I needed it and who knew I was competent enough to handle most things.  Now I have a supervisor who knows that I've been here two years and that my scores consistently put me in the top 50 performers ... but she tries to get out of taking escalations by giving me ""tips"" to de-escalate and telling me to go back to the customer with some compromise they've already declined.  (Gee ... I think I have a good handle on how to de-escalate a call by now.  If I'm asking my supervisor to take the call, I've done everything I can and the customer has asked for the manager.  Just take the flippin' call, because sending me back onto the phone will just make the customer angrier and make sure they give a ""no"" response on that customer satisfaction survey.  Awesome.)

Many are shoved, but many top notch people leave of their own volition. People who seem to be highly valued and an integral part of the work culture will one fine day simply disappear. They hire mostly specialists and maintain a very lean team. Competency alone does not suffice for job security. They will let people go once their project is completed if there is no immediate need for their specialty. They pay very well, but load engineers with high amounts of work. Because the dev team is kept so lean, there is little opportunity for moving to a different group and there are few growth opportunities. It is highly political in the management ranks and lots of jockeying for position, surprise surprise.

The compensation is skewed in that there are no bonuses or stock grants for the rank and file employees. Insurance for anything beyond the employee ( significant other / family ) will be passed along to the employee. In many cases I've heard this can pretty expensive.

Unlimited PTO","Fear-based, highly competitive culture driven by upper management. Mid-management is forced to follow the suit otherwise it will be their job on the line. Everyone is under pressure to deliver but nobody provides guidance as to what is expected. If you're a super-star you're supposed to figure it out on your own.
Zero tolerance to even small mistakes - you're expected to work as a perfect robot. If you made a mistake you're out immediately, no chance for correction.
Zero communications about your performance - it is all up to management to decide how you're doing. So you don't know whether you made or making mistakes.
Project management does not exist, hence no planning is happening, just loose email exchanges.
You don't feel as part of the team, there are virtually no teams, just people trying to prove something and keep their jobs. As a result many decisions are short-sited since they provide immediate credit, long-term decisions are usually on back-burner until all of a sudden they become critical and then it is all hands on deck.
You're expected to work long hours  and weekends on regular basis.
Basically if you accepted an offer you're owned by Netflix.

The fact that you pay high salaries and provide unlimited PTO does not mean that you own people's lives. Give people freedom for mistake, at least one.

If you are not a really smart, driven person who can operate completely independently and with little direction from management, then you will not be happy or successful at Netflix.

If that lights you up and excites you, then you will love working at Netflix.",Its going to be a challenge to preserve the unique culture as the company grows.

Some organizations are terrible (i am not talking about IT/ back-office type group) when it comes to  recognizing people, allowing (forget about encouraging) their growth. No carrer, no recognition. In a way, its a career dead-end. Its a JOB.

Recent break-neck hiring has bought in a TON of managers (e.g. instead of bringing in 1 project manager, they've hired &gt;1 managers). Believe it or not, it takes 4 times the amount of meetings (compared to 2 years ago at Netflix) to get 1/2 of what we used to get done in the same period of time.

i would love to hear from the management about what data they have to back this up this bs.

Nice break area with complementary tea, coffee, fruit.

Friendly co-workers.
Pleasant work space- comfortable desks, chairs, clean appearance.
Breaks are CSR responsibility.  You have a schedule, but you decide whether it's best to go on break or take one more call.

They love to BS in the chatroom, but when someone asks a real question suddenly it seems like no one is home.  On the rare occasions when you do have an escalated call that you can not resolve, supervisors avoid your messages in order to avoid dealing with the dissatisfied customer.  

There is very little positive feedback.  On days when I did everything correctly - 0% customer dissatisfaction (by survey response), low handle times, etc., the supervisor never said a word.  The moment you have a long call that pushes your time up, they call you on it.  Regarding any such poor performance: it was very common for embarrassment tactics to be used in response instead of constructive criticism.","Find better ways to recognize your good employees.

Most days the ""What's working?"" list is shorter than the ""What's broken?"" one.

No communication between departments. Customer service is forced to make things up because the Netflix ""engineering"" or ""research"" teams don't give any sort of information to the reps regarding estimated time to service restoration during outages. I put engineering and research in quotes because, as a CSR, you never actually speak to them. They are merely referenced, like mythology or fairy tales.

Reps are given goals that are nearly impossible to consistently meet, in what I believe to be a fairly obvious system that gives Netflix an opportunity to fire virtually any employee for not hitting their metrics. You basically are there by the grace of your boss, if they want to find a reason to get rid of you it will be fairly easy for them to do so.

The customer dissatisfaction is worded in such a way that many people are leaving feedback on Netflix, not the individual rep, but this DSAT number must be below a certain percentage or you risk losing your job. You are basically encouraged to burn through as many calls as quickly as possible, placating the customer or flat out lying to them (blaming their ISP, home network, or device manufacturer) enough that they'll be compelled to say that they're satisfied after you say ""please stay on the line for a one question survey"" and then promptly hang up on them. 

There is absolutely no way that you are going to have consistent, quality interactions in 4:30 minutes or less, ESPECIALLY after the missteps that Netflix has made this year. But if your numbers drop, or you spend too much time trying to help out, be prepared to be ""coached"". 

Coaching is such an absurd term, because it implies that there is a sort of team camaraderie or human aspect. My last coaching session with my boss involved being told that I was not giving my all. I was only supposed to be a contractor for 59 days. I was supposed to have health insurance by now, and some security as an employee. Instead we are told that they can only afford to hire on so many people, and better luck next time, but you're welcome to stay on as a temp if you like! So yes, I don't really feel like giving my all. Despite putting in consistently good numbers, multiple people on my team have told me (independently) that they are afraid of being fired at any time.

I get the feeling that many people are there only until they find something else. Netflix was actually a considerable pay cut from my last job, but even if the pay was higher the way they treat their employees is at the top of the list of the worst employers I've ever personally experienced. Work / life balance is non-existent. While going through some personal issues in my life, my supervisor told me to ""leave it behind me"" when I walked in the door, not offering anything close to a compassionate response.

One last observation: the people I've noticed who seem to be TRULY happy there are the ones who are too young to know any better. I'm not old by any means, but I'm also not an 18-24 year old kid who doesn't realize that jobs don't need to be like this, that you can actually be treated like a human being and be *inspired* to perform, rather than doing it because you fear for your job on a daily basis. Eventually Netflix will chew them up and spit them out, too. Ask yourself why anyone should give loyalty to a company where an employee celebrating a 6 month anniversary is considered a veteran? 

Also, the positive reviews on here are probably left by Netflix management. It cites things they don't even offer anymore at the Hillsboro facility (like free mac&cheese, and, oh I dunno, BENEFITS for most of the people here). You will most likely be a temp with Netflix (meaning no benefits) until you quit or get fired.

I've been lucky enough to work for some truly amazing companies, and Netflix is definitely not one of them.","This is simple. Learn to communicate. Start treating your CSRs like human beings. Stop encouraging CSRs to lie to customers. Tucking tail and rescinding your decision to split the company doesn't magically make you a ""feedback driven company"", it means that you got called out on BS and you're backpedalling."

This isn't just on the ground floor either, one day everything's fine and the next ten managers are let go and their teams dispersed amongst the remaining set (but everything's still fine guys, don't worry).  There is almost zero room for advancement, managers are hired in from the outside and the best anyone hired at entry-level can expect is to become a CSR-2, a position that doesn't actually pay more.  Anyone and everyone competent seemed to slowly leave for better jobs in my time there, and at first I wondered why when they had so much going on, but eventually I figured it out.

Decent pay if you can stick it out, but way more stressful than it needs to be, and I'm not talking about the customers; an old man yelling at you for thirty minutes because his blu-ray stopped working is nothing compared to not knowing if you're going to be fired that week because you had a sick day three months ago and your calls aren't short enough.",Act less like the captains of a sinking ship.

-Changes made quickly after start so some training tools were useless such as:
-Have to keep up with 3 different metrics--which is fine except for the Average Handle Time is 5.5 min--which in training was not an issue. This metric supports customers who know what they're doing such as: how to use a PC, know what kind of PC they have, IF it is in fact a PC, aware of any info on their devices.  In other words a lot of elder cust may feel frustrated that agent is more worried about handle time instead of providing best cust service experience. Double Digits are not your friend. So trying to troubleshoot a technical issue with someone who is not very tech savvy in under 9 minutes or calming an irate cust because the system charged them even though they deserved a free trial or the NUMEROUS calls for payment authorizations which cause a lot of cust to have to keep double the amount of their service cost on their card at all times

-Technical training is not a requirement but you'll notice most of Team Leads or CSR2's are very techy--which makes for satisfied cust because they may be able to explain why their internet may not be working properly in a confident knowing manner. Overeducating is a no-no but you will find them doing this. 

-You are basically encouraged to hurry the cust through the phone call and if they cannot speak English (no spanish support) you are encouraged to have them get an interpreter--also if they are not computer savvy (like some elderly people) you are encouraged to have them try back later when they can get someone to help them. Its basically refer refer refer refer when you can. Not really customer service based or rather not really customer-based. 

-Telus very strict scheduling environment. Make sure your attendance and adherence are on point
-Recording phone calls and allowing you to listen to all your mistakes or rather having a supervisor point out things you did wrong (not much Pos feedback) and write you up for it is supposed to be a method of ""coaching"" but feels more like Big Brother. The threat of being let go is constantly hovering over your head. 
-The position itself seems highly energetic but is unstable--no career focus there
-Turnover is atrocious. which leads to back-to-back calls with no breaks between. Being late or absent on weekends is double the penalty. And the schedule can change without notice.","If you're at a job for 8 hours a day--and it's not supposed to feel like work--then FUN--give us a reminder.

Lousy communication between groups.

Able to surf non work websites such as imgur, facebook, and linkin while at work. Communicated with coworkers on facebook almost as often as I did thru work chat. 
Pretty chill environment considering it was a call center. Metrics were very reasonable and not that big of a challenge to reach.
Days off weren't hard to get if they were scheduled way in advance (at least 6 weeks).","No pay raise the entire time I was there, everyone was paid the same rate and nobody got a pay raise unless they changed jobs. In fact our pay in benefits (used to have 10k allowance per year and anything not used was put into our paycheck) was taken away - at the same time the CEO got a $1 million bonus, hmm....
Felt like a dead end job. No opportunity to advance beyond the call center.
Often had to be the bearer of bad news to customers (price change, delivery changes) and found out from customers before company told us.","Don't treat employees like they can't tell what you're really doing. We knew $1 million bonus money came out of our benefits fund. Trying to ""positively position"" a statement when we do that all day to customers feels demeaning. Just give it to us straight. 
Also, tell us what's happening BEFORE a customer tells us. Just makes the company look bad when they know before we do."

They have a robust service that is well architected, and they have discipline that has been honed for over a decade to become the best at what they do.  As so many leadership books say, you can tell way more about someone by what they say NO to, and how well they can say NO.  Netflix doesn't do ads, pay-per-view, purchasable content, or porn.  Just thoughtful, edgy, and family programming so you can enjoy your subscription.  They're bigger than people perceive, around 3,000 at time of this writing, but still have that startup feel of ""just get stuff done.""  They get rid of all unnecessary process, so even in management, I can spend most of my time focusing on adding value to our customers instead of administrivia.","Netflix prides themselves on hiring super senior people that are like a pro team.  Everyone is treated like a professional.  You won't find any interns at Netflix.  You'll only be working with people that have been in the industry and are smart at what they're doing--but that doesn't mean they're smart at everything.

Simple, indisputable example: you can't decide how much you make, yourself. That's an obvious statement, yet it proves there definitely are no-goes and as such, gray areas. In practice, it hasn't been an issue for me--just clarifying. You want X number of monitors, Y super-amazing-computer, come in at 11am, leave at 4pm, take numerous vacations, ask (and receive a real answer!) dang near anything about what movies/shows they're secretly bidding on in Hollywood, etc, etc. Not only things a reasonable person would want to do/have, more like a well spoiled person. This all assumes you are communicating this with your team and performing well above average--Netflix does *not* knowingly hire junior, mid-level, or wannabe-senior engineers. I haven't personally seen a bunch of people get fired, but of the one or two I've seen, it was not surprising. I have noticed some teams are more critical of performance than others.

Like any company of a decent size, not every team has exactly the same culture. Mine was absolutely wonderful day-to-day. My managers help you and coordinate, more than ""manage"" me, which is huge just by itself. To this point, most engineering managers I know of aren't really programmers, which I think is a huge bonus because there is far less risk of them wanting to micromanage projects and implementation details. That said, they are ALL very very technical and  can fairly trivially smell BS.

Salary: you'll be more than happy as far as I've heard from co-workers. For me, they made it impossible for me to ever even consider leaving because of salary. Almost every place I've worked prior, I had at some point felt underpaid. Not here, I felt very much appreciated and paid as such.

Summary: YMMV, like in every big company, but seriously that's super important to understand, but my experience was amazing and by far the best place I've ever worked, all things considered. I left for personal reasons that aren't related to Netflix--wife/family stuff.","If you're not a high performer, but you manage to sneak in, the fear of being canned could certainly be real since YOU WILL inevitably be discovered. But don't second guess yourself. It should be obvious whether or not you are a high performer.

Sometimes discussions on the Freedom and Responsibility culture turns sort of cult-like. With a select number of people, questioning its real-world implications has been met with very clear disgust, almost denial. Very rare, though. For me was trivial to brush off.","Do: continue soliciting feedback both positive and negative/constructive. Do continue to hire top-tier talent only. Do continue tweaking the culture.

Don't: continue having 360s, some how foster year-long feedback instead. Don't use terms or policies defined as ""unlimited"", which is in practice about as ""unlimited"" as AT&T's data plans were in 2011. It makes almost every coworker I talked to uncertain about what it means in practice and of course made things vary among teams."

I just needed proof that this job exists. Also a customer service representative I had the opportunity to speak with was totally unaware that Netflix had such a job, just as I was too. Plus the option to pick what movies we review for you would be nice, And maybe get paid more for choosing odd movies that many people haven't seen."

You are challenged daily to become better at your job, and you're given the tools and the training to do exactly that! You're coached weekly and your leaders are great motivators and great people to interact with. It's like everyone gives a damn about their careers, and their own personal growth as well as YOUR career and personal growth!

Other Perks: Great wages, 401k, very affordable Health Insurance (after your temp agency contract is over and they convert you to full-time Netflix). The building I work in is pretty great. It's a fun and colorful atmosphere with a lot of 20-and-30-somethings working hard and having fun! Around every corner is some kind of Netflix branding that's related to one of their shows, like Orange Is The New Black, or House of Cards. There's a cafeteria that cooks fresh food for you during the day (Vegetarian options included!). And Netflix covers half the cost of the meals so you can get really great lunches on the cheap! Free coffee (there's even an espresso machine to make your own lattes - also free!). And there's occasionally Netflix swag given out, like windbreakers, water bottles, even Netflix labeled sweatpants! It's easily the best place I've ever worked!","If you don't give a damn about your career or your own development, you won't last long. The talent pool is also extremely saturated with highly skilled people, which makes it very challenging in terms of promotions. 

Because it's a call-center, there can be a bit of turnover with the staff. This is pretty common for call centers in my experience, and terminations always seem to happen for the same reason: Attendance

If you get terminated for attendance, it's because you were prone to missing work frequently. They will also let you go if you're a tool to your customers on the phone calls you take. A good rule is don't swear at, or start freaking out at them. Follow this and you should be fine. You're graded on your Customer Satisfaction levels and how active you are at putting in the practice to get better. If you're not getting better at your job, or you're not working on the areas where you need improvement, you'll get let go. But your Supervisors are pretty good at telling you exactly what needs work, and they work with you to get to where you need to be. And if you're in any danger of getting terminated, either due to your performance or your attendance, your Supervisors are pretty upfront about it, giving you plenty of fair warning as well as an opportunity to turn it around. Generally speaking, if you get fired from this place, it's because you either didn't care, or you didn't show up.","I'd like to see more healthy food options, especially in the Avanti Markets. Or better yet would be to remove the Avanti Markets all together! They're stupid-expensive compared to everything else on site and the snack options are mostly garbage.

Pay and benefits are amazing.","Please stop firing amazing talent. Other posts here paint the wrong picture -- that those who survive at Netflix are the best. It is inaccurate at best. The quality of many of those let go is not in doubt, but management is frequently inept at appreciating their ability. Many who stay are very bright, but many who are let go are as well.

If you do not tow engineering's backwards line you are looked down upon. People live in constant fear of being canned and this causes them to behave in an immature fashion painting their peers as less than they are. Some seem to delight in the plight of others who are let go -- a mentality of ""better him than me."" It is not survival of the fittest, it is a blind thought police, who speak openly about wanting to hear others' opinions (as long as the opinion agrees with theirs) and then balk when they are actually given. Alternatives are not actually wanted, obedience and maintaining the status quo are. If you are to be disruptive, you must be disruptive in their way. If that makes no sense it is because it is truly illogical.

One can hope this is not so pernicious as to infect every team and I would dare to say that it isn't. But do your homework and know what you are getting yourself into.","Look inward to a policy and culture that perhaps on its surface appears attractive but hides an ugly story of fear and a need to conform which stifles creativity and achieving quality work. Quality need not be continually sacrificed in the name of ""getting sh** done.""

You were a once great company with great engineers. Stop it with the culture of fear. Just stop it. It does not encourage making the right decisions, people do things to protect their job and high salary, not because it is the best thing to do. It is poisoning the work and you are and can be better than that. Also do not fool yourselves with those who pay lip service to the culture in public -- in private, I have found, they lambast it.

The center here in SLC has also stopped promoting people internally- a majority (if not all) of the supervisors in the last several months were hired externally. This is another example of changing values at Netflix; rather than giving current (well qualified) employees opportunity for growth, they hire people unfamiliar with the process and product, which further impacts the floor negatively.","Resume promoting internally rather than hiring externally.

You'll be working with mostly extremely competent people. Dealing with teams within the company is extremely easy, as most people are very helpful and efficient. They pay you a lot of money, and give you perks like free food, paid cell phone bill, 401k, etc. This is all great, but for me, the biggest draw is always people, and your team will make or break your experience here, so make sure you know what you are getting into at the interview, and don't accept jobs with teams that you don't feel excited about being part of.","The high salary leads some people to ramp up their lifestyles, they then become dependent on being here. This in turn creates a culture of fear where people are constantly stressing out that they are ""not doing enough"" and might be fired any minute. This also extends to the directors of teams, and when your management is stressed, it will always trickle down to create a lousy experience for you.
This makes for an extremely toxic environment at times where teams are often working on similar projects, thus competing against each other to stay relevant, which is just utter idiocy. The high pay ensures that there is way more politicking than would be needed or appropriate in such situations. This in turn can have a very demoralizing effect on the peons doing the actual work, who often feel compelled to work on nights, weekends and public holidays for goals that are often vague, and projects that are often shelved. The most insidious effect of this is observed when people contemplate taking PTO, when many employees have told me that they weren't able to relax or take as much time off as they needed, as they were constantly wondering what would happen to their jobs, and whether or not they were doing enough to ""deserve"" time off. If you've never felt this, it's a rotten state of mind, and you will feel it quite a bit here.
Many times, I've felt the need to quit the field altogether, but the money and my team makes me stay for now, so I'll likely stay till my team changes.

Moral of the story here is: You'll get paid a lot. You'll also likely be laid off sooner than you expect. You'll also likely make a LOT less at your next place. Adjust for your standard of living appropriately so you can keep your head above the circus fray, and don't get used to the good things.","More communication with your teams is absolutely essential if you want to retain good people, but you don't need a Glassdoor review to tell you that. Empower your HR teams to instill the idea that taking time off is a healthy part of working here, and no one should feel nervous about taking time off. You will need to say this many times before it becomes part of the culture.

Ensure that teams are not competing against each other, specifically in the Engineering department. We are not here to throw each other off our respective ladders, but to learn, and to help the company grow as a result of what we learn here. Cross-collaboration between teams should be of the utmost priority, not working at cross-purposes as is the case with many teams now.

For the most part, this is a good place to be. Make it better, and make more of an effort at every level to keep the organization flat. We already have job insecurity, we do not need hierarchy to make it worse."

I've been very diligent in updating the HR coordinator over leaves about what's going on after each appointment, to which I rarely get a response. Then a few weeks after my last check up email that I sent to this HR Coordinator I get a response that's basically threatening my position as I'm not getting better fast enough,  demanding I bring in proof of extention by the end of the week. I have no problem with providing documentation for them. I do have an issue with when I ask a HR Coordinator if they have a fax number that I could send this to as traveling is a bit difficult for me at the moment or when I ask about the process of maternity leave I get a three sentence email basically saying I don't know and text me if you have questions.  Then when I email saying I'm unfortunately phoneless at the moment til I can get it repaired can I just email. I get no response at all! They say they care,  they don't.

Energetic environment. New technologies.","Experience in Netflix totally depends on the supervisor. If you are lucky and get a matured manager, there is no reason to not like working in NETFLIX.  However it could be a nightmare if your manager does not like you for some reason. It is always your words vs manager's word in there (happened in my case and they believe the manager). I was hired under a manager who convinced me to join Netflix (I had 24 emails from that person persuading me). However I learned after joining that I am supposed to report to a new manager and the very first day that new guy complained that I have never worked with JAVA and AWS (Then why did he agree to take me in his team in the first place ? ). Nightmare started from that very day.  He kept on mentioning the same thing every one on one. He forced me to move my position in every meeting and make sure I seat where he points me to. He will talk to all my co-workers and inform them if he is cancelling one on ones, for me he wont do anything and just disappear. He 
will constantly irritate me saying how good he was when he joined. He will always shout at me and try to ignore my opinions on any damn technical stuff. I was totally terrified of him and knew that he will make sure that I fail. He tried all he could.   He gave me two projects and one project scope kept changing and changing. Still i tried to keep up and developed good relationships with other team managers, members and project managers.One day (I am sure my manager was waiting for that day) I wrote something incorrect in an email (this is my 4th month I guess). He pounded on me, and also after a 14 hour continuous on call, I took a 2 min break, he shouted at me for 15 minutes for missing a false alram ! I apologized. He tried to blame me for what I did not do and said he and someone else was watching me silently, while I was chatting with someone else about some technical issue over a group chat. So unethical !  He said some PM complained about me and when I asked for the names and examples he refused. I raised the alarm to higher management and they said it is ""his word vs mine"". One day they said they are sorry I had to go through this and next day they change the tone and said they have to believe my manager. I requested them to talk to engineers and get feedback. They refused to even do that.  I resigned the next week as I could not take the humiliation and realized that if I stay back and work in the same group, they will find some excuse to fire me. I knew all companies where I worked before were waiting to take me back any day. So I had no worry.  The funny part is the people who were working with me kept on sending me emails about how good it was to work with me and they were surprised that I left. But my manager never found anything good in me. 

I wish I had a better manager in NETFLIX, then I would enjoy my life there so much. Please make sure you understand your supervisor before you join. That is the most important thing. Everything else will fall into place.","Give engineers some more respect and try to understand who is at fault. Look at that persons history before you conclude in 4 months or 5th months just based on one person, the manager who was not happy with the hire from very very first day."

If you're full-time the culture makes it easy to make your little slice of work your own.","They treat contractors like crap. Well at least this is the case in the department I was in. You are hamstrung by being a contractor and not having access to all information, not even knowing that you need access to this information or not even realizing you are missing information until it's too late. That might not be a problem for all contract positions, but as a project manager, it's essential that we are least made of aware of any news that might possibly affect the components we are in charge of.

The diversity is tragic. It's not as bad as many other Bay Area tech companies, but there is a lot of instances where one sibling gets another one in, one spouse will get another one in, friends from previous employment hire each other to recreate whatever made them leave the original company,  etc.

I worked in a department with mainly an international team and when I started there were several comments made by my coworkers about how, because of my nationality, I therefore couldn't possibly understand certain issues like internationalization. I found several of the people to be very condescending if you didn't come from X school or worked at Y company.

The lack of feedback from your manager is non-existent. Again this might just be a contractor thing but for me I found that the majority of my coworkers were happy with my work, my stakeholders were happy with my work, I'd received kudos from my manager, etc. Then when a full-time position came available I applied and was essentially told by my manager that I wasn't good enough. I won't argue that decision because it's subjective but isn't it the Netflix policy that if a manager isn't happy with their employee it's best to just let them go and then find the best fit? After all, if I'm not good enough to be at Netflix then why are still keeping me around? I can only speculate as to the reasons so it's not even worth me writing them here.

Also in general, I know very few contractors since the time I've been here who have been converted to full-time. Some have been here as long as 2 years or longer.","Don't say you are committed to diversity if you really aren't paying attention to the hiring practices of the B and C level managers who are all too often just hiring their buddies.

Netflix is scaling rapidly with new people and new products. My suggestion would be to find a way to facilitate interdepartmental learnings, this way you don't run the risk of people duplicating efforts."

The chat team was dissolved, and then they shifted my hours to meet 'business needs' which took away the last bit of faith I had that they care about the employee.

Could also mean that you work there for 2.5 years like my coworker and never get to have a weekend day off. 
In training they told us over and over again that top performers were promoted within 3 to 6 months but there have literally been no opportunities. They said numbers didn't matter, they promised unlimited time off, and a whole host of other perks. That has all been blatantly false, the entire job is a numbers game, you sit glued to your desk waiting for a coaching or meeting to break up the nightmare of the day but those keep getting pushed off to the future, which never happens. Unlimited time off was taken away, and you could be fired for a whole host of silly reasons, I myself have seen multiple coworkers walked off the floor for minor infractions, and the new policy of only 3 tardies (which could be 1 minute late) per YEAR is punitive. Even the free drinks are slowly being taken away, we have stupid lemon water options now or espresso, which I can't drink. This job has given me anxiety, I am actively looking for a different job and will quit the moment I'm able.","Don't lie to your employees, hire enough people so that you're not glued to the phone with back to back calls all day, promote an option of breaking up the work day instead of sitting stuck in the cubicle. You can't even take personal time for crying out loud, you get in trouble for needing to take a 2 minute bathroom break outside your schedued break time. Ive never had a job that so horrendously micromanages time to be sure you're getting every last second of work from the employee. Actually be truthful about advancement opportunities. I was told CRS2 would be avaliable August of 2016, that got pushed to January of 2017, then March of 2017, and now maybe 6 months into the future.

You are verbally abused everyday by the customer. The technology and the Knowledge base can chance on you, so you need to be extremely adaptable.

If someone starts calling you names, you can not hang up and you can not make outbound calls.

You are held to metrics and those standards are extremely difficult to maintain unless you have been working in a call center for 5 years. If you do not perform you will be written up.

One of those metrics is your call back rate, handle time (less than 5 and 1/2 minutes) and DSAT's (less than 4%) which translates into 1 NO in the survey.

Attendance is non-negotiable. I was sick for 9 weeks (I had my voice for less than 25% of the time) and I even brought in a doctors note explaining my situation and I STILL got written up. 

They have shift bids, which means that every 6 months you can bid for a new shift. If your metrics are mediocre or bad, then you will be moved to what every shift they give you. Most places try to put you in shift according to your requests and needs. This is not that place. You can bison your own shift...and possibly keep it. My call center lost half of their work force due to the previous shift bid. They said they were going to try and change it to make it more ""fair"", but when I left, they can completely removed my shift time.

The pressure, the anxiety, the fear. They have been massively hiring and now they are firing, for no reason. Well, from what I have seen it's either because they thought they needed you but they really don't, or because you are about to become too expensive after roughly 2-4 months with health insurance etc..The bottom line is you are not treated like a grown up but just as a tool and management is completely useless.",Don't hire someone unless you really need him/her. That person who you hired and fired has probably turned down another good job offer at another company that now is no longer on the table.

Freedom and responsibility is definitely practiced here. No one will hand you a project, deadlines, and a specific way to go about doing your work. They trust that they've hired the best people to do the job and they leave it up to the individual to identify problems and figure out how to solve them. This sort of environment is not for everyone, because you have to build strong enough relationships with your coworkers so they'd go to bat for you on your projects. Team-building isn't a company-mandated activity here. It's an everyday practice and an integral part of the job.

Feedback is candid and immediate, so get ready. There's no sugarcoating here. To be successful here, you have to be open to criticism, no matter how direct. This, again, might not work for everyone, but it makes your next course of action very clear, as opposed to sugarcoated feedback that leaves you confused as to what you should do.","Netflix gets a bad rap, because it's not for everyone. The fact is, that's not necessarily a bad thing, and there's no shame in trying something out and seeing if it works out for you. What appears difficult about Netflix is exactly what makes it a great place to work. You have to be able to manage yourself, no one will manage your time for you.

While the company is not as diverse as it could be, the commitment to diversity is something I've witnessed first-hand from leadership and employees alike. The tone is set that diversifying the company is a part of everyone's job at Netflix, not just the recruiting team.

If you need someone to manage your time for you, need your tasks to be very clear and outlined by a manager, or you can't handle feedback, then Netflix isn't for you.","Continue fostering employee relationships, and emphasize the importance of making those connections as early as possible in an employee's journey."

I mean, look at how long it took them to change the logo and get some design standards going.  Design often times felt like a luxury than a necessity and there was a bit too much dependency on A/B testing to make decisions.  I swear, I heard ""have we A/B tested this yet?"" in my dreams.  A few times, I would point out that the results of the A/B test resulted in bad design solutions.  It just seemed like upper management didn't understand design.  As long as people are watching content and streaming patterns are on the up, then don't rock the boat.  Also, watch out for those who play politics, sometimes the drama that plays out on projects or team dynamics is just unreal and some people just want to be the hero and get Reed Hasting's blessing.

During my time there , I worked as hard as I could because I genuinely loved my job and where I worked . This specific location in clearwater is nice because they do give you a lot to do while on the phone and during idle time . There's foosball , a ping pong table , and a "" NRD lab"" where they have probably 8 tvs on the wall where they play different netflix tv shows and movies ( Supposed to be SFW but sometimes , especially very late at night we could watch whatever we wanted) There were also multiple tv's across the floor in about half of the pods and sometimes they would put on sports games and things to keep us happy . If you take all of that into consideration it sounds pretty great. All in all , I think most people there genuinely want to get the job done as quickly and efficiently as possible . The biggest issue they have is the people who are put into management . Even before I was there , there had been a line of people who all had been promoted purely because they were close with the right people . When it came to promotions ( To either CSR II or TL ) there was no rhyme or reason really what so ever. When you were put up for a promotion , they would tell you that it was going to be based off of stats, attendance, and professionalism . That is not usually what ended up happening . In my experience there the person that had some personal tie to either a specific TL or OM would always be the one to get the promotion . It was this way for absences as well . The attendance policy is on a rolling 60 day timeframe . That means ; you may not have more than 4  ""Occurrences""  in 60 days or you would come up for review . When occurrences were actually given was definitely not regulated. The way around this is just basically to take 3 days off in a row if you're going to call off . People would apply for a weekend off and never be able to get it because they didn't allow very many requests those days . So the solution that they came up with is that if you were close to a TL , you could get them to put you on a MLOA or a PLOA . Better yet , be friends with an OM and you can literally just call them like your personal attendance line and get VTO (Voluntary time off) . Favorites WERE played. Now , there are some GREAT people there. I met some really really great friends there . But the problem is that they don't have a great way of dealing with anything . If something went down , there was no uniform way of dealing with it . When controversial topics would come out we were basically told not to say anything conflicting or anything that could get us or them into trouble. But when it comes to people calling screaming at you about a show called ""Dear White People"" calling you racist and asking RIDICULOUS questions , the ""No comment"" thing doesn't really work . Your performance is based off of handle time, Re contact rate , and your survey answers mostly .  The Highest you are allowed for dissatisfaction is 4% I believe (It may have changed now I'm not sure ) That means you are counting on someone being merciful on their bad day , and that the kid who called you through the app who you HAVE TO send to survey doesn't hit you as well . The last thing I will say , is that the scheduling is based off of performance and attendance . Not like that is a huge issue , but the problem is that there are not very many earlier schedules . I would say there is probably 7 teams on the floor from 6 AM  until 1-3PM  and even then they are sending people home left and right most mornings . After 3 there is a lot of calls and you usually will be on the phones non stop until around 10 or 11 when it slows down. There are over night schedules, but you have to START working after 8PM to get the extra dollar and they cut the overnight teams down to 1 or 2 when I was there . This means that if you don't get almost perfect stats , you may be given a bad rank during the quarterly shift bids , and get stuck with a schedule that you can't work or just simply don't want . Maybe one or two schedules have weekends off and those obviously get taken first . I will let you take from this what you will . It is a great way to get your foot in the door . The company I am with now JUMPED at the chance to hire me because of the experience I gained here. Not only will it help you professionally , I gained a lot of technical experience and now am looking toward a career in IT . Just don't allow yourself to get swallowed up in the machine and you can definitely be successful ."

They really are willing to challenge the status quo and test new ideas. Things are not always arrived at efficiently, but it is great to see innovation throughout the company and not just in tech groups.

Amazing maternity leave but I had to pay quite a bit out-of-pocket for decent family health benefits, bizarre stock option plan, weak vision/dental

- The culture of fear is real in some groups
This is because it depends on your leader.  Some leaders manage up well and hide their incompetence by constantly changing their staff. I was the 3 leader of my team in a 4-year period. Also leadership does not enforce the same ""stunning colleague"" standards for non-critical orgs. 

- HR is fairly ineffective (except staffing is great)
HRBPs enable incompetent leaders because they are dependent on them. If a leader gains new teams then typically the HR person gets bigger scope as well. If the business leader doesn't ""connect"" well with their HRBP, you are likely to see the HRBP get a ""generous severance package.""

- Your job can change fast, both good and bad
Be prepared that you can gain new teams and responsibilities quickly, but you can also go from being stunning to out the door in a matter of weeks. I think people get the high standards communication really well from the culture deck, but the speed with which your personal circumstances will change can be shockingly fast.",Please apply the same quality standards to all parts of business leadership.

They are an accurate cross-section of experiences that show the reality of working at Netflix and how entirely it depends on your manager, or who gets fired or promoted and suddenly becomes your manager. You will have zero life outside of work, and even if you are someone who could never imagine being considered anything other than a top performer, let alone getting fired, recognize that you--yes, you--will very likely be let go abruptly within your first year--sometimes in a matter of weeks--with no opportunity to improve, at the sole discretion of your manager, who him/herself may or may not be competent or honest. Be sure that you can afford to live in whichever very expensive city you are relocating to with no income, and are willing to explain a firing in your next job search. Political backstabbing is the order of the day. The meeting culture is horrendous and symptomatic of an organization that is growing too rapidly and clutching desperately to a culture that doesn't scale. Ask anyone who has been at Netflix in a leadership or cross-functional position and they will tell you that they spend their entire day in meetings, and then spend all of their nights and weekends at home trying to actually get work done. And finally, if you do survive beyond the first year, don't expect pay progression. They will happily offer you more than whatever you are getting in your current position to bring you in, and then leave your pay stagnant for years if you were already ""over market.""","Recruiting away top talent and churning through them with no regard for them as human beings may have been a viable strategy when Netflix was a smaller company, but understand that many of the industries you need to recruit from are small and nearly tapped.

The culture document is mainly a PR document. The culture in much of the company doesn’t actually match the culture document. The document is interpreted differently by the different orgs, VP’s and managers. At most, it’s applied to some IC’s, but doesn’t apply to management. 
 
There's a lot of politics between teams and orgs when there are overlapping projects and services. And having overlapping projects on different teams happens often. Negative and deceptive politics exists between teams in different orgs. It’s more rare, but it appears to be accepted and ignored. 
 
There’s a large amount of internal team politics, as each engineer needs to make himself look better (and others worse) to keep their job, to get to the next pay level, to become a manager, etc. This will get worse as the company grows in size. Management is purposefully oblivious to all of this. 
 
HR is a weak org. Their main job is recruiting. They do very little to make the company culture adhere to the culture doc. 
 
Management is self-centered and arrogant. They won’t acknowledge real problems until it smacks them in the face. This creates the appearance of a kool-aid environment. Most employees will ignore the issues to get along and reduce friction. The environment will worsen over time. 
 
Management does not help with career growth. 
 
No official IC titles other than Senior Software Engineer. This practice is likely followed to reduce turnover so people don't realize that they’re not paid enough money or promoted high enough, as compared to others there. They are deciding your pay based on external info, so they’re probably privately assigning a title to you, anyway. As far as career growth, this becomes an obstacle.

2. You can’t get up and use the bathroom. Your breaks and lunches can be moved around (if approved by WFM) so they tell you to move your break up so you can get up and use the bathroom. You literally have to fill out HR accommodation forms to have certain privileges such as bathroom use. 
3. You had an emergency? If you have the emergency hours to cover it, GREAT! But if you don’t, expect to be put on probation or fired the next time you walk in. They expect you to PTO 24 hours before and it’s like they wanted you to anticipate the emergency 24 hours before. 
4. Coaching is a joke. Literally the sups ask us what WE want to work on. What we thought of our own performance and place those ideas into our action plan. My question is, aren’t the sups suppose to know the problems? Aren’t they suppose to be the ones prepared for the meeting and have a course of action? It feels like I’m doing their job and they just say “great idea let me write this down and submit it!” They will ALWAYS tell you what you are doing wrong but unless upper management makes a comment about moral being down, they will never compliment you.  
5. Utah is a right to work state. In plain English it means the company doesn’t need to have a reason to fire you, hence why a lot of other big companies place their call centers here. This law allows some employers to abuse the stability of employees and base their decisions on emotions instead performance.","You want us to live by NetflixCS values yet your own supervisors don’t live up to those values. Stop making it seem like it’s ok to voice our opinion when in reality you fire people for crossing that line or for exposing upper management. You do not provide a stable working environment, nobody leads by example, stop promoting people that are ill equipped for the promotion and most of all stop treating us like customers by POS POS (keeping things positive and avoiding the problem to focus on what CAN be done) and dancing around our questions or concerns."
