Detectives look at the evidence of a case, analyse it and ask many (many) questions throughout the process, make up inferences based on the evidence, and the narrow everything down to a set of conclusions when everything is said and done. This is, in a way, the same process a data analyst undertakes for a project. To understand this better, let's look at the Data Analytics Cycle.\n",

Facebook know which kinds of posts you like the most, and has a good sense regarding your political inclinations based on the things you post. Amazon always seems to know what to recommend you to buy (and crap, it seems to work). Now you start getting curious about all of the data your smartwatch might have about you so you decide that it is time to take control of your own data before others analyse it for you.\n",

It allows you to combine different tools that are paramount for a good coding workflow. For example, you can have the terminal, a Jupyter notebook, and a markdown file for note-taking/documenting your work, as well as others, opened at the same time to improve your workflow as you write code (see image below).\n",

These add-ons may be clothes, shoes, accessories, slang words, and other physical objects such as cars, houses, boats, etc. In Python, our add-ons become additional programs other people have created in order to make a specific workflow easier.\n",

    "Data visualisation, more than being part art and part science, is one of the key components of the data analytics cycle.

By using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, data visualization tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data.\" ~ [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/learn/articles/data-visualization)\n",

    "Data Visualization as a field of study has been on the rise for over many decades now --if not centuries-- and it is an exciting area to be a part of. Organisations such as the [Data Visualization Society](https://www.datavisualizationsociety.com/), FreeCodeCamp, and others, have extensive information on how to go beyond simple data visualisation, should that be something that interests you.

    "## 6.2 Quantitative vs Qualitative\n",
    "\n",
    "When we get to the data visualisation stage of the data analytics cycle, we should always keep in mind the nature of the data we would like to visualise. If we want to see relationships (correlations between variables) we might only choose quantitative variables for our visualisations. If we want to show a specific theme in our dataset, e.g. gender differences, customer type, or potential customer, we might just opt for visualising frequencies in qualitative data. In contrast, if we want to show the relationship of variables given a specific group in our dataset (e.g. income differences by gender), we would choose a combination of qualitative and quantitative variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "To give you a more concrete example, I have burrowed the following table from a book that I highly recommend if you want to really get started with data visualization, and that is, _\"Fundamentals of data visualization: A primer on making informative and compelling figures\"_ by Claus O. Wilke.\n",

    "Now that we are aware of the subtle differences in data visualization, how do we know which visualisation to create with the data we have? The answer is that it will depend on the context of your task, and on how much information you would like to convey in your visualisation. As you decompose a task to choose the best course of action for your visualisation, keep the following diagram in mind from ActiveWizards."

    "## 6.3 Static vs Interactive Visualizations\n",
    "\n",
    "An important aspect to keep in mind is when creating visualizations is whether we should represent our data in a static or interactive format. As analysts, we should always ask ourselves, will our message reach our audience better if they were able to interact with the visualisation? The reason behind this can be captured in a very famous quote by Benjamin Franklin.\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Tell me and I forget. Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn.\" ~ Benjamin Franklin\n",
    "\n",
    "If the goal of our visualisations is to teach something to our audience chances are that, allowing them to interact with our visualisation will do just that. Let's talk a bit more about static and interactive visualisations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.3.1 Static DataViz\n",
    "\n",
    "Static data visualisations are those meant to show one or several facts about the data in a specific way. They help us convey a message and are often used closely with other narratives. For example, the New York Times is one of the most famouss new agencies in the world not just for the top content they manage to craete and provide to the masses, but also for the beautiful visualisations one can find in their large amounts of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Static visualisations are also often embedded in inforgraphics to carry a message even further. Think about the graphs that are displayed in broshures that tell us to buy a fragance or a particular type of cutlery alongside a statistic, some often say \"75% of those who purchased these products have experienced...blah blah blah\". Watch out for those :)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.3.2 Interactive DataViz\n",
    "\n",
    "Interactive data visualisations tell different stories while letting the users pick which one they would like to see or understand better as they evaluate the piece of work. These kinds of visualisations can be very powerful tools not only to convey messages to many people but also to provide top-notch educational content for others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Involving your audience through interactive visualisations can be a much more involved process though. A static visualisation can be saved and shared with many in a matter of minutes. Interactive visualisations, on the other hand, might require a web application to work and be displayed, making it more difficult to show it to people on the go. Dashboards and other tools, while requiring a bit more work to be put together, can have a lot useful interactivity in them."

Rougier and it can be found in his article called, \"_[Ten Simple Rules for Better Figures](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003833)_\".\n",

    "- Data visualisation is great for exploring our datasets\n",
    "- It allows us to see interesting patterns in the data that might not be visible upon first inspection\n",
    "- Satatic graphs are great for telling a story from one angle\n",
    "- Interactive visualisations are great for involving the audience with the message we are trying to convey as well as for ourselves to change the story as we please\n",
    "- Python has excelent tools for visualisation and [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/index.html) is just one of them\n",
